*"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing"*
	*- Alexander Pope*

Why is it that some knowledge makes us all belive we're suddenly experts? I'm not even sure how to begin going about answering that question, but I hope to help explain how a development team can prevent a little knowledge from derailing their project. 

Everyone who has worked on a software project aiming to improve a real-world problem knows that building great software requires great understanding of the problem at hand. However, most organizations never take the time to understand what great software actually is. Personally, I think this happens because everyone has their own definition of "great".

 To the user, a great piece of software is likely one that provides them value beyond the cost of the software. Although in actuality, great software needs to be a value-multipler by providing the user significantly more value than purchasing & using the software costs them. A simple example of a great piece of software is Microsoft Excel; it can be extremely complicated to build a spreadsheet, but the alternative of doing ledger-based calculations by hand is orders of magnitude less efficient. 

What about me, the developer writing the software? What do I believe makes great software? Personally, I think an elegant solution to the problem at hand makes great software. Hand-waving aside, a great piece of software is one which quickly and effeciently does exactly what it is supposed to. Or to quote Mike Gancarz: *"Make each program do one thing well."* This philosophy encourages a simplicity of interface and implementation that makes it significantly easier to reason about the code (hence the beauty). This obviously means you may end up building & composing several small programs in order to meet a user's needs.

Finally there's the business-person's take on great software. Whether they're sales or a development manager, great software to them is likely something that generates more revenues for the company than it costs to build and maintain. Pretty simple for them, just make sure the software keeps you in the black...

Now that we have a shared understanding of what makes great software comes the hard part; how do you keep a little knowledge from leading you astray and creating bad software (ostensibly anything that fails any of the above criteria)? 

### Speaking the Same Language

To illustrate the importance of speaking the same language lets take a quick detour into modeling a problem. For example, if I were thinking about improving the restaurant ordering experience I'd need to understand the basics of how a restaurant operates.
