Functional design is hard. It's probably easier than good object oriented design, but that's like saying climbing Everest is easier than climbing K2; at a certain point it's all relative. Good functional design, like good problem solving, revolves around breaking down a problem into small, solveable chunks then composin those chuncks back together into a solution. At the point when it no longer makes sense to break down a problem, you have what's called a primative. This isn't the Java primative you learned in school, but rather a no-longer-decomposable unit of functionality for the problem domain at hand. 

This concept of itteration & termination is essentially mental recursion in the problem space.
